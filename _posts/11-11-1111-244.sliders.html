<p>You probably know the game <i>Fifteen Puzzle</i>. Here, instead of numbered tiles, we have seven red tiles and eight blue tiles.</p>
<p>A move is denoted by the uppercase initial of the direction (Left, Right, Up, Down) in which the tile is slid, e.g. starting from configuration (<b>S</b>), by the sequence <b>LULUR</b> we reach the configuration (<b>E</b>):</p>
<p><div style="text-align: center;">
<table cellspacing='0' cellpadding='2' border='0' align='center'>
<tr><td width = '25'>(<b>S</b>)</td><td width='100'><img src="project/images/p244_start.gif" /></td><td width = '25'>,&nbsp;(<b>E</b>)</td><td width='100'><img src="project/images/p244_example.gif" /></td>
</table>
