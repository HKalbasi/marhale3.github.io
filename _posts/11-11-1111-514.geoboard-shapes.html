<p>A <b>geoboard</b> (of order <var>N</var>) is a square board with equally-spaced pins protruding from the surface, representing an integer point lattice for coordinates 0 ≤ <var>x</var>,<var>y</var> ≤ <var>N</var>.</p>

<p>John begins with a pinless geoboard. Each position on the board is a hole that can be filled with a pin. John decides to generate a random number between 1 and <var>N</var>+1 (inclusive) for each hole in the geoboard. If the random number is equal to 1 for a given hole, then a pin is placed in that hole.</p>

<p>After John is finished generating numbers for all (<var>N</var>+1)<sup>2</sup> holes and placing any/all corresponding pins, he wraps a tight rubberband around the entire group of pins protruding from the board. Let <var>S</var> represent the shape that is formed. <var>S</var> can also be defined as the smallest convex shape that contains all the pins.</p>
