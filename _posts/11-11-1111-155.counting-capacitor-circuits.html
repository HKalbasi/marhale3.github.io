<p>An electric circuit uses exclusively identical capacitors of the same value C.
<br />
The capacitors can be connected in series or in parallel to form sub-units, which can then be connected in series or in parallel with other capacitors or other sub-units to form larger sub-units, and so on up to a final circuit.</p>
<p>Using this simple procedure and up to <var>n</var> identical capacitors, we can make circuits having a range of different total capacitances. For example, using up to <var>n</var>=3 capacitors of 60 <img src='project/images/p155_capsmu.gif' width='12' height='21' alt=''  style='vertical-align:middle;' />F each, we can obtain the following 7 distinct total capacitance values: </p>
