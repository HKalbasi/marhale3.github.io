<p>A printing shop runs 16 batches (jobs) every week and each batch requires a sheet of special colour-proofing paper of size A5.</p>
<p>Every Monday morning, the foreman opens a new envelope, containing a large sheet of the special paper with size A1.</p>
<p>He proceeds to cut it in half, thus getting two sheets of size A2. Then he cuts one of them in half to get two sheets of size A3 and so on until he obtains the A5-size sheet needed for the first batch of the week.</p>
<p>All the unused sheets are placed back in the envelope.</p>
