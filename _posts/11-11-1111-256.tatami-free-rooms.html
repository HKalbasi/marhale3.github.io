<span style="font-size:10pt;">
<p>Tatami are rectangular mats, used to completely cover the floor of a room, without overlap.</p>

<p>Assuming that the only type of available tatami has dimensions 1&times;2, there are obviously some limitations for the shape and size of the rooms that can be covered.</p>

<p>For this problem, we consider only rectangular rooms with integer dimensions <var>a</var>, <var>b</var> and even size <var>s</var> = <var>a</var>&middot;<var>b</var>.<br />
We use the term 'size' to denote the floor surface area of the room, and &mdash; without loss of generality &mdash; we add the condition <var>a</var> &le; <var>b</var>.</p>

<p>There is one rule to follow when laying out tatami: there must be no points where corners of four different mats meet.<br />
For example, consider the two arrangements below for a 4&times;4 room:</p>
