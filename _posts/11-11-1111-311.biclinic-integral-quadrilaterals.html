<p>ABCD is a convex, integer sided quadrilateral with 1 &le; AB &lt; BC &lt; CD &lt; AD.<br />
BD has integer length. O is the midpoint of BD. AO has integer length.<br />
We'll call ABCD a <i>biclinic integral quadrilateral</i> if AO = CO &le; BO = DO.<br />
</p>

<p>For example, the following quadrilateral is a biclinic integral quadrilateral:<br />
AB = 19, BC = 29, CD = 37, AD = 43, BD = 48 and AO = CO = 23.
